Starter project for anyone to create a fleet to experiment with cloud IoT integrations. It includes System Metrics [block](https://github.com/balena-io-examples/system-metrics) to collect performance metrics from a device, and Cloud Relay [block](https://github.com/balena-io-examples/cloud-relay) to publish those readings to a cloud IoT provider like AWS, Azure or Google Cloud.

This project expects that the cloud IoT infrastructure already has been generated. See the *Cloud Provisioning* [section](https://github.com/balena-io-examples/cloud-relay#cloud-provisioning) of the Cloud Relay documentation.

## Getting Started

Create a fleet in your balenaCloud account by clicking on the Deploy button below. Remember to set the fleet variables for your cloud IoT provider, as described in the *Configuration* [section](https://github.com/balena-io-examples/cloud-relay#configuration) of the Cloud Relay documentation.
